task 1:  Create a Landing Page using your preferred tech stack
🌿 EchoLife – Landing Page

As part of my Web Development Internship at OctaNet (June 2025 – July 2025), I completed Task 1: Create a Landing Page on a topic of my choice using the technologies I’m most comfortable with. I chose to build a bold, modern, and student-friendly landing page for EchoLife, a conceptual lifestyle app for students.

🔍 About the Task
The objective of this task was to design and build a fully functional and visually engaging landing page that:

Introduces a product/service/app clearly

Showcases features or benefits

Contains a call-to-action

Is responsive across devices

Demonstrates good UI/UX practices

I decided to create the landing page for EchoLife, a personal project idea I’ve been working on. EchoLife aims to support students in tracking expenses, discovering hostel/food options, exploring investment ideas, and planning weekend activities — all in one platform.

💡 Project Highlights
The landing page was built using pure HTML and CSS, and deployed on GitHub Pages. I chose a bold and contrasting visual theme — matte black background with neon green accents — to grab attention and resonate with a tech-savvy, youthful audience.

The page contains the following sections:

Hero Section

A strong headline to welcome users

Brief overview of EchoLife’s mission

A glowing “Try Now” button that acts as a CTA

Features Section

Highlighted EchoLife’s four core features:

Budget Planning

Hostel & Food Discovery

Investment Suggestions

Weekend Planner

Each feature is explained in brief with icons or visuals

Feedback Section

A modern contact form allowing users to share suggestions or ideas for EchoLife

Fields for Name, Email, and Suggestions

The design aligns with the rest of the theme and includes responsive styling

Responsive Design

Fully optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile

Typography and layout scale fluidly

Interactive Styling

Hover effects on buttons

Transitions for form focus

Clean UI with bold fonts and glowing elements

⚙️ Tech Stack Used
HTML5 – semantic structure and layout

CSS3 – styling, responsive design, animations

GitHub Pages – live deployment

This task allowed me to refine my CSS skills, focus on layout structure, and experiment with minimalist UI techniques. I did not use any frameworks intentionally to demonstrate my raw frontend capability.

💬 Outcome & Reflection
The landing page now serves as a front door to my EchoLife project and sets the tone for its upcoming development. Through this task, I learned the importance of visual consistency, clear messaging, and user-driven feedback collection. One of the key lessons was how subtle design elements like spacing, color contrast, and button interaction can influence user engagement.

Moreover, working on this task gave me a good sense of planning content flow — from headlines to CTAs — while also considering how to encourage interaction (e.g., feedback form). I received a lot of positive feedback for the design aesthetic and usability of the page.


This task helped me grow as a frontend developer, and I’m excited to continue building EchoLife as part of my broader web development journey. Task 1 was an incredibly fun and educational experience! 💚💻
